= Introduction =

wxpos is a pos software that should support the use of:
  * Barcode readers
  * Receipt printers
  * Cash drawers
  * Stock maintenance
  * Daily/Monthly/Weekly reports of sold products
  * Customer listing
  * And many more functions that should be easily added based on the need

= Idea =

wxpos is made with Python, using wxPython (subset of wxWidgets).
  * [http://python.org Python] is used because it is cross-platform mainly.
  * [http://www.wxpython.org/ wxPython] is used for the GUI (graphical user interface) because it is also cross-platform, and provides a native look on any platform.

wxpos is designed to be easily migrated to any database system (although currently it is only working with MySQL, it "should" be easy to change it)
