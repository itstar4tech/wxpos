#summary Configuring and using the database

= Introduction =

wxpos is designed to be database independent. Currently it is working with MySQL.
In the pos/database directory, there are currently 4 files:
  * base: defines the BaseDB class, which defines the base methods of the DB object: connect, close, error.
  * mysql: defines MysqlDB which inherits from BaseDB and defines the methods for connection, query execution, error handling...
  * __init__: defines the DB class, the actual class that will be used. It inherits from MysqlDB in this case.

= Configuring MySQL =

In addition to that there is a dialog for configuration in pos/modules/base/dialogs/dbconfig.py
This dialog is used when running wxpos-config. You can then choose the mysql host, username, password, port, db name, ...

Run wxPos-config.py to configure the database tables, currently on MySQL only...

= Note =

The migration to other than MySQL databases will be made soon by using [http://www.sqlalchemy.org SQLAlchemy]. This will make it all independent of the dbm you use.
You will be able to choose between MySQL, PostgreSQL, sqlite, ...
Read more about SQLAlchemy for all the options you will have.
