#summary Configuring and using the database

= Introduction =

wxpos is designed to be database independent. Currently it is working with MySQL.
In the pos/db directory, there are currently 4 files:
  * base: defines the BaseDB class, which defines the base methods of the DB object: connect, close, error.
  * mysql: defines MysqlDB which inherits from BaseDB and defines the methods for connection, query execution, error handling...
  * __init__: defines the DB class, the actual class that will be used. It inherits from MysqlDB in this case.
  * subset: The class defined here is the base class of the modules' db part. It is kind of a way of "subclassing" the main DB class.


NOTE: The db module is still not stable, so the subset might be useless, and maybe this is not the way of doing it.

= Configuring MySQL =

In pos/db/__init__.py, in the definition of the DB class, the host/username/password/db_name are defined in the __init__ method.
Change those values to suit your needs.
