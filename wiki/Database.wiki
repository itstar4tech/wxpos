#summary Configuring and using the database

= Introduction =

wxpos is designed to be database independent. Currently it is working with MySQL.
In the pos/database directory, there are currently 4 files:
  * base: defines the BaseDB class, which defines the base methods of the DB object: connect, close, error.
  * mysql: defines MysqlDB which inherits from BaseDB and defines the methods for connection, query execution, error handling...
  * __init__: defines the DB class, the actual class that will be used. It inherits from MysqlDB in this case.

= Configuring MySQL =

In pos/database/__init__.py, in the definition of the DB class, the host/username/password/db_name are defined in the __init__ method.
Change those values to suit your needs.

Run wxPos-config.py to configure the database tables, currently on MySQL only...

= Note =

The database module is still not stable, and i think it would not work on any other database system than MySQL.
I should make sure, and then make the small changes for it to "maybe" work.

UPDATE: What I was doing turned out to be almost the same as SQLAlchemy. I was trying to recreate the wheel, but I saw immediately it was too hard and too much work. I had decided to only use it with MySQL.
Now that i know about SQLAlchemy, I will migrate the app to it (it will be hell of a mess), but i'll stick for now to mysql...
