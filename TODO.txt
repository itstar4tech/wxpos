#########################

base
** should the config be included here? for db now, but also for other modules for the future, like there is managePanel, there might be some kind of ConfigPanel

currency
** add the ability to change the default currency in the config panel
** make surea link to the currency is established anywhere there is a price mentioned

user
** add a menu restriction object which links a permission to specific Menu items(parent, child). Many-to-Many-relationship.
			Use something like select distinct to get all the menu items allowed per role/user.

customers
** still has the address and contact tables not set up, make sure to make it up to date and arrange the panels accordingly
** customerdiscount: discount, product_id, customer_id; might be useful (like in posper)

stock
** if no payment method is allowed, the first one is enabled by default. this is a bug not a feature.
** add ability to set buy price, sell price, taxes (like posper)
** review the stock panels
	max value set to 100 and min value to 0 in stock diary quantity spin control
		check to see if there is the same problem other places
	arrange, when adding products the ability to insert initial quantity also (+make sure it is added to the stock diary as init or modification)

sales
** numbering of tickets: 123874773887 is not readable. something like 2012-12-45 is.
** transfer of old tickets to older tables. use the same principle as used for "soft deletion" (with 3 tables and ForeignKeys)
** Print functionality
** Cash drawer functionality
** Cash register functionality (close cash): cash difference, date open date close, user, etc...

payments
** payment: Provides the ability to add shop payments made for maintenance, salaries, stock buying or other expenses or incomes to keep track of cash flow.

taxes
** taxes: Useless for now.

reports
** make sure all of the following are present and working:
	- sales
	- customers
	- stock
	- stock diary
	- users
	- what else ? nespresso :D
** add a way to export to excel or stuff add a button (format)
** add a save as button + print button + view
** add the choice of currency for the report, and choose one by default, depending on customer and default currency.
** the getFilename should not be in the panels submodule, but in the objects part, and it will be returned
** in stock report, add the choice between show only in stock, only available, only discontinued ...
** add the ability to filter by (i think most are useless):
	- payment methods
	- pay date range (if not equal to close date)
	- close date range
	- customer choice
	- paid or not
	- buy hour
	- amount
	- currency
** make a common function to let all tickets, ticketlines, etc. look the same in a pdf report. plus the options to show this n not that, blabla.ex: ticketList(_id=id, show_payment=True, show_date=False, show_user=True, ...)
** make one common thing for footer, header, things like that (style, wutever)

** soft delete or not? i think yes [[[ NO SEE COMMENTS INLINE IN CODE ]]]=> should be implemented at the getAll, delete, update level => meaning at the common object level
** test with other than mysql and sqlite, try (postgresql), or maybe some other thing supported by SQLAlchemy
** create a module called log or something that will write the details of db actions to a page of the toolbook

#########################
#	GENERAL		#
#			#
#########################
** add a init function to each module that will make it load upon starting app like first time config + no user logged in or similar
** we can stop using the thing like Item(data1, data2, ...) and use i=Item();i.data1 = data1;... that way we could use i.currency_id = 1 OR i.currency = whatever and choose to ommit certain default values
** menu, resource system for icons, not images directory ./images/menu/%s-%s.png
** config system, some kind of config.py file in each module with the parameters/default/whatever and a panels/config.py config panel referenced in __init__.py .... plus a page in a Notebook for each module

** images
** taxes
** location (warehouse thing)
** add visible modifier to the users table, to set whether or not to show him in the main dialog
	+ make a 'secret' shortcut for 'super user' to enter his user, password, with full access
** resource system for templates and stuff, was in mysql db, i think its better to be in a file in the 'base' module, not bad huh?
** floor and place (for restaurants)
** reservation
